description: Git add all, commit with Claude, and push to current/new feature branch
---

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Remote info: !`git remote -v | head -1`
- Change scope: !`git rev-parse --verify HEAD > /dev/null 2>&1 && git diff --stat HEAD || echo "(no commits yet)"`
- Recent commits: !`git rev-parse --verify HEAD > /dev/null 2>&1 && git log --oneline -5 || echo "(no commits yet)"`

## Your task

Work through these steps in order:

### 1. Orient
- If the working tree is clean (nothing to commit), stop and report — nothing to do
- If on main/master, create a new feature branch with a descriptive name based on the changes

### 2. Bump version (before staging)

Detect the project type and bump the version based on the nature of the changes in context.

**Bump rules** (based on what you observe in the diff):
- Breaking API/behavior change → **major** (X+1.0.0)
- New feature or capability → **minor** (X.Y+1.0)
- Everything else (fix, chore, refactor, test, docs, etc.) → **patch** (X.Y.Z+1)

**Process:**
1. Read the current version from the primary manifest (first match: `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`)
2. Determine bump type from the changes in context (the commit prefix you'll write in step 4 should match)
3. Calculate the new version
4. **Update the version in ALL of these files that exist in the repo:**
   - `Cargo.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[package]` (or `[workspace.package]` for Rust workspaces)
   - `package.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
   - `pyproject.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[project]`
   - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
   - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
   - `gemini-extension.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
5. If Rust: run `cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock` (it records the version) — if `cargo check` fails, stop and report the error
6. Report: `Version: X.Y.Z → A.B.C (bump type)` and list which files were updated

**Skip conditions:**
- Version is `0.0.0` or `0.0.1` (project not yet versioned)
- No manifest file found
- The `--no-bump` flag was passed as a skill argument

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md (before staging)
If a `CHANGELOG.md` exists in the repo root:
- Find the most recently documented commit in the changelog (look for commit hashes in the table)
- Run `git log --oneline <last_documented_sha>..HEAD` to get undocumented commits
- If there are new commits, update the changelog:
  - Add new rows to the commit summary table (newest first)
  - Update the Highlights section with grouped summaries
  - Keep the existing structure and style
- If the changelog format is unrecognizable (no commit hash table, no clear anchor), skip rather than guess
- If no CHANGELOG.md exists, skip this step

### 4. Stage, commit, and push
- Stage all changes with `git add .`
- Create a meaningful commit message following the repo's conventions
- Always include Claude's co-authorship trailer:
  ```text
  Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- Push to remote:
  - New branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
  - Existing branch: `git push`
  - If push is rejected (remote has new commits): run `git pull --rebase`, resolve any conflicts, then retry the push

### 5. Post-push: save session context
After the push succeeds, invoke the `save-to-md` skill to capture session context.

**Notes:**
- If creating a new branch, name it based on the changes (e.g., `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/navbar-styling`)
- The changelog update is part of the commit — it goes in the same commit as the other changes
- End with a summary of what was pushed and the branch name
- List all unfinished tasks in the session and next steps for the user to consider
- If any step fails (e.g., version bump, changelog update, push), report the error and stop the process to avoid partial commits
- Never force push or delete branches without explicit user instruction
