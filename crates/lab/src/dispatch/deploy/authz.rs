//! Authorization gates for the deploy service.
//!
//! Deploy requires a dedicated token separate from the general MCP bearer:
//! `LAB_DEPLOY_TOKEN` must be set in the environment before any plan/run/
//! rollback action is accepted.
//!
//! Destructive deploy actions (`run`, `rollback`) additionally require live
//! MCP elicitation when called over MCP. A client that does not advertise
//! elicitation cannot bypass the confirmation by simply setting
//! `params.confirm = true` — we refuse it at this layer.
