Agents can advertise a set of slash commands that users can invoke. These commands provide quick access to specific agent capabilities and workflows. Commands are run as part of regular [prompt](./prompt-turn) requests where the Client includes the command text in the prompt.

Advertising commands
After creating a session, the Agent **MAY** send a list of available commands via the `available\_commands\_update` session notification:
```
`{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "session/update",
"params": {
"sessionId": "sess\_abc123def456",
"update": {
"sessionUpdate": "available\_commands\_update",
"availableCommands": [
{
"name": "web",
"description": "Search the web for information",
"input": {
"hint": "query to search for"
}
},
{
"name": "test",
"description": "Run tests for the current project"
},
{
"name": "plan",
"description": "Create a detailed implementation plan",
"input": {
"hint": "description of what to plan"
}
}
]
}
}
}
`
```

##
[​
](#dynamic-updates)
Dynamic updates
The Agent can update the list of available commands at any time during a session by sending another `available\_commands\_update` notification. This allows commands to be added based on context, removed when no longer relevant, or modified with updated descriptions.
##

](#running-commands)
Running commands
Commands are included as regular user messages in prompt requests:
```
`{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"id": 3,
"method": "session/prompt",
"params": {
"sessionId": "sess\_abc123def456",
"prompt": [
{
"type": "text",
"text": "/web agent client protocol"
}
]
}
}
`
```
The Agent recognizes the command prefix and processes it accordingly. Commands may be accompanied by any other user message content types (images, audio, etc.) in the same prompt array.
