Plex API: Add an Item to a Playlist - Plexopedia
[ Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/plexopedia)
Each user on a Plex server can [create their own playlists](/plex-media-server/general/create-playlist/). A playlist can contain either videos, music, or photos, and can't be shared with other users. There are smart and non-smart playlists. This API command will add a single item to a non-smart playlist.
## URL
```
PUT http://{ip\_address}:32400/playlists/{playlist\_id}? uri=server://{machine\_id}/com.plexapp.plugins.library/{library\_id}&X-Plex-Token={plex\_token}
```
### Parameters
|Name|Description|
|ip\_address|The IP address of the Plex Media server.|
|plex\_token|The [Plex user token](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/#getcurrentusertoken).|
|playlist\_id|The key associated with a playlist. This key can be found by calling the [view playlists for a user API command](/plex-media-server/api/playlists/view/) and getting the value in the `ratingsKey` attribute.|
|machine\_id|The ID associated with the Plex server. Can be found by calling the [Server Identity](/plex-media-server/api/server/identity/) command and getting the `machineIdentifier` attribute value.|
|library\_id|The key associated with the library item to be added to the playlist. See below for information on this value.|
## Return Status

|400|Bad request - A parameter is missing or the media item is not valid for the playlist.|
|401|Unauthorized - The Plex token provided is not valid.|
|404|Not found - The playlist ID is not valid.|
## Response
XML string value that provides details about the playlist for the item that was just added. An example of the XML return value is shown below:
```
\<MediaContainer size="1" leafCountAdded="1" leafCountRequested="1"\>
\<Playlist ratingKey="289273" key="/playlists/289273/items" guid="com.plexapp.agents.none://3d6e93e8-3217-4f29-ad50-bd389abca279" type="playlist" title="War Movies" summary="" smart="0" playlistType="video" composite="/playlists/289273/composite/1698191973" duration="12356000" leafCount="2" addedAt="1684802334" updatedAt="1698191973"\>\</Playlist\>
\</MediaContainer\>
```
The XML return provides information the playlist that contains the added item. The root is the `MediaContainer` element. This element contains a single attribute indicating that one playlist has been returned from the server.
MediaContainer Attributes|Attribute|Description|
|size|The number of playlists returned.|
|leafCountAdded|The number of items added to the playlist. If 0, then no items were added to the playlist.|
|leafCountRequested|The number of items requested to be added.|
Within the `MediaContainer` there is one `Playlist` child element. The `Playlist` element contains information on the new playlist on the Plex server.
Playlist Attributes|Attribute|Description|
|ratingKey|A key associated with the playlist.|
|key|The relative URL of the items in the playlist. This URL returns information about the [items in the playlist](/plex-media-server/api/playlists/view-items/).|
|guid|The unique identifier comprised of the Plex agent and playlist identifier for the agent.|
|type|The type of media.|
|title|The title of the playlist.|
|summary|A description of the playlist. This can be changed by editing the playlist from within Plex after it has been created.|
|smart|1 - playlist is a smart playlist.
0 - playlist is not a smart playlist.|
|playlistType|video - playlist contains videos/movies.
audio - playlist contains audio/music.
photo - playlist contains photos.|
|composite|The URL of the image used to represent the playlist.|
|duration|The total duration, in milliseconds, of the number of items in the playlist. This value doesn't exist for photo playlists.|
|leafCount|Number of items in the playlist.|

|updatedAt|The date and time in [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), the playlist was updated in the library.|
## Remarks
### Library key parameter
The `Library Key` parameter value can be found if you access the Plex server from the Web app.
When you hover over any item - movie, TV show, music, photo, etc. there will be a `key` parameter in the URL. That key value is the value you will use for the `Library Key` parameter.
The value is easy to find in the URL of the item. It has the structure `/library/metadata/{id}`. You will use the entire value of the `key` parameter from the media item URL.
## Examples
curl Python Powershell
```
curl -X PUT http://{ip\_address}:32400/playlists/{playlist\_id}? uri=server://{machine\_id}/com.plexapp.plugins.library/{library\_id}&X-Plex-Token={plex\_token}
```
```
import requests
plex\_url = http://{ip\_address}:32400/playlists/{playlist\_id}? uri=server://{machine\_id}/com.plexapp.plugins.library/{library\_id}&X-Plex-Token={plex\_token}
response = requests.put(plex\_url)
print(response.text)
```
```
$response = Invoke-RestMethod 'http://{ip\_address}:32400/playlists/{playlist\_id}? uri=server://{machine\_id}/com.plexapp.plugins.library/{library\_id}&X-Plex-Token={plex\_token}' -Method PUT
