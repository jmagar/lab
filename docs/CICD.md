# CI/CD

Last updated: 2026-05-01

This document is the authoritative contract for CI, release, and artifact delivery in `lab`. All pipeline implementations must conform to this spec.

## CI Checks

Every push and pull request must pass all of the following:

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Frontend build | `./.github/actions/build-gateway-admin` (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build` in `apps/gateway-admin`) |
| Compile | `cargo check --workspace --all-features` |
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Lint | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings` |
| Deny | `cargo deny check` |
| Tests | `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` |

Clippy runs with `-D warnings` — zero warnings are permitted. This is enforced at the workspace lint layer.

The frontend build is required because the Rust binary embeds the exported
Labby assets. It is a production build gate, not a TypeScript strictness gate:
`apps/gateway-admin/next.config.mjs` currently sets
`typescript.ignoreBuildErrors = true`. Run `pnpm test` in
`apps/gateway-admin` for the frontend unit/ACP test contract.

## CI Platform

- **Provider:** GitHub Actions
- **Job split:**
  - Frontend assets build once, then Rust compile/lint/test jobs download the exported `apps/gateway-admin/out` artifact
  - Fast checks (frontend-assets, check, fmt, clippy, deny, test) on every push and PR
  - Release builds on `vX.Y.Z` tags only
  - Publishing after successful release builds

## Build Matrix

| Platform | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Linux x86_64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux aarch64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
Release builds currently publish Linux artifacts only. Fast checks run on
Linux x86_64 only.

## Integration Tests

Live service integration tests are **excluded from CI**. They require real service instances and are run locally only.

```bash
# Local only — never runs in CI
just test-integration
```

Integration tests must be marked `#[ignore]` so `cargo nextest run` skips them without explicit opt-in.

## Release Process

1. Bump version with `cargo-release` (single workspace version)
2. `cargo-release` tags the commit `vX.Y.Z` and pushes
3. The `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers the release CI job
4. Release job builds frontend assets once and reuses them for each target build
5. GitHub generates release notes from the tag diff
6. Artifacts published to GitHub Releases

**Tag format:** `vX.Y.Z` — no other formats are accepted.

**Version policy:** single version across the entire workspace. `lab` and `lab-apis` always share the same version number.

## Artifact Distribution

- **Surface:** GitHub Releases
- **Artifacts per release:** one binary per Linux target (Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64)
- **No package registry publishing** (crates.io, npm, etc.) unless explicitly decided

## Size Policy

Binary size is tracked but not hard-gated in CI unless repo tooling enforces a monolith size limit. If a size gate is added, it runs in the fast check job.

## Frontend Tests

Gateway-admin tests are local/developer verification today. They are not part
of `ci.yml`.

```bash
cd apps/gateway-admin
pnpm test
pnpm test:acp
pnpm test:browser
```

## Non-Goals

- no telemetry pipeline
- no background analytics
- no phone-home behavior in any CI or release step
